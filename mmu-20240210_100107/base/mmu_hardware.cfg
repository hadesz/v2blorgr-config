## Happy Hare MMU hardware config file with config for EASY-BRD-RP2040
##
## Common external mcus:
## 1) EASY-BRD
##  J6 Jumper setting
##   Option 1: Pins 2-3 and 4-5, i.e.  .[..][..] (recommended)
##   This allows for option of "touch" selector setup. Note that this enables the option disables the "extra"
##   switch so the toolhead sensor (if used) would have to be connected to the main mcu
##
##   Option 2: Pins 1-2 and 4-5, i.e.  [..].[..]
##   It you don't care about selector touch operation. The "extra" switch is enabled for other uses
##
##  Note that the EASY-BRD does not expose the DIAG pin for the gear stepper
##
## 2) Fysetc Burrows ERB
##  No jumper configuration is required for Fysetc Burrows ERB board. Both Selector and Gear DIAG pins are exposed
##
##  ERB firmware flashing notes:
##   Must have 12v/24v supply connected
##    > make menuconfig (rpi2040, No bootloader)
##    > make
##  Put card in boot loader mode: Press & Hold 'BOOTSEL' ; click 'RST; ; Release 'BOOTSEL'
##    > make flash FLASH_DEVICE=2e8a:0003
##
## ------
##
## Note about "touch" endstops: Happy Hare provides extremely flexible homing options using both single steppers or synced steppers.
## The "touch" options leverage stallguard and thus require the appropriate 'diag_pin' and stallguard parameters set on the TMC driver
## section.  If you have the diag_pin exposed, it is harmless to define this because they will only be used when explicitly needed
## and configured.
##
## Touch option for each stepper provides these benefits / possibilities:
##  - on extruder stepper allows for the automatic detection of the nozzle!!
##  - on selector stepper allows for the automatic detection of filament stuck in the gate and subsequent recovery
##  - on gear stepper allows for the automatic detection of the extruder entrance
##
## These sound wonderful right?  They are, but there are caveats:
##  - The external EASY-BRD and ERB mcu's are terrible at detecting stallguard and often result in an "undervoltage error". It is generally
##    possible to get selector touch (TMC2209) tuned especially if you set 'stealthchop_threshold' to a value greater than homing speeds and
##    less than move speed. I.e. the stepper runs in stealthchop mode when homing. [klipper experts will know that it switches the chip mode
##    automatically to stealthchop and then back for Stallguard2 support, howver the automatic switching back to spreadcycle at the end homing
##    move seems to provoke the error condition and setting 'shealthchip_threshold' appropriately avoids this condition. More than you wanted
##    to know I'm sure!
##  - I have not had much luck with touch (stallguard) on the gear stepper with EASY-BRD and ERB mcu's and you really want the extra torque
##    of spreadcycle so adjusting 'stealthchop_threshold' is not really an option
##  - Enabling on the extruder stepper is viable but you will likley have to change jumpers on your main mcu to expose the DIAG pin for
##    whichever driver the extruder stepper is connected to.
##
## In summary, "touch" homing with your MMU is an advanced option that requires patience and careful tuning.  Luckily everything works with
## regular endstops and there are creative workaround options for certain homing points (like extruder entry) in the absence of any endstop.
## I'm really interested in creative setups that you come up with. Ping me on Discord (moggieuk#6538)

# HOMING CAPABLE EXTRUDER --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# With Happy Hare, it is important that the extruder stepper definition is moved here to allow for sophisticated homing and syncing
# options.  This definition replaces the stepper definition part of you existing [extruder] definition.

# IMPORTANT: Move the complete stepper driver configuration associated with regular [extruder] here and comment out the
# original driver config in your printer.cfg

## both endstops (for homing) and sensors for visibility purposes.
##
## 'pre_gate_switch_pin_X' .. 'mmu_pre_gate_X` sensor detects filament at entry to MMU. X=gate number (0..N)
## 'toolhead_switch_pin'   .. 'toolhead' sensor detects filament after extruder entry
## 'extruder_switch_pin'   .. 'extruder' sensor detects filament just before the extruder entry
## 'gate_switch_pin'       .. shared 'mmu_gate' sensor detects filament at the gate of the MMU
##
## Uncomment sensors that are fitted. Note: older method of defining toolhead sensor still works but this way is recommended

## MMU OPTIONAL NEOPIXEL LED SUPPORT ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##
## Define neopixel LEDs for your MMU. The chain_count should match or be greater than your number of gates.
## Requires the installation of Julian Schill's awesome LED effect module: https://github.com/julianschill/klipper-led_effect
## LED index 1..N should be connected from gate #0 to gate #N
## LED index N+1 can optionally be connected to exit from MMU (like encoder in ERCF design)
##
#[neopixel mmu_leds]
#pin: mmu:MMU_NEOPIXEL
#chain_count: {mmu_num_leds}		# Number gates + 1 (if you want exit effect)
#color_order: GRBW			# Set based on your particular neopixel specification
#
##
## Define LED effects for MMU gate. 'mmu_led_effect' is a wrapper for led_effect
## (if included on your system) and will accept and create the defined effect on both
## the entire specified part of the strip with the name you supply but also on each
## individual LED up to N+1 gates by adding `_<gate+1>` suffix. This makes it much
## easier to have per gate effects.
##
## E.g. You define mmu_flash on a 3 gate MMU:
##  [mmu_led_effect mmu_flash]
##
## This will create effects:
##  mmu_flash on whole define strip
##  mmu_flash_1 on for gate 0 (LED index 1)
##  mmu_flash_2 on for gate 1 (LED index 2)
##  mmu_flash_3 on for gate 2 (LED index 3)
##  mmu_flash_4 for MMU exit  (LED index 4)
##
## Then you can set effects with commands like:
##  SET_LED_EFFECT EFFECT=_mmu_flash      # apply effect to all leds in strip
##  SET_LED_EFFECT EFFECT=_mmu_flash_1    # apply effect to the second led (gate 0)
##
## or set simple RBGW color with commands like:
##  SET_LED LED=mmu_led INDEX=2 RED=50 GREEN=50 BLUE=50 WHITE=0 TRANSMIT=1
##
## Note that gates start from 0, LED index starts from 1, so by default, index = gate + 1
## Ranges are constrained as much as possible to allow for additional custom LEDs
## to be wired after the N+1 position
##
#
## These are used selectively on gate LEDs and exit LED...
